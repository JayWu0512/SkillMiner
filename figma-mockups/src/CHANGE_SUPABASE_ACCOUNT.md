# How to Change Supabase Account

You can configure SkillMiner to use your own Supabase project by following these steps:

## Step 1: Get Your Supabase Project Credentials

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project (or create a new one)
3. Go to **Settings** → **API**
4. Copy these two values:
   - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://yourprojectid.supabase.co`)
   - **Project API Key (anon/public)** (starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`)

## Step 2: Extract Project ID

From your Project URL `https://yourprojectid.supabase.co`, the project ID is the part before `.supabase.co`

For example:
- URL: `https://abcdefghijklmnop.supabase.co`
- Project ID: `abcdefghijklmnop`

## Step 3: Update the Configuration File

Edit `/utils/supabase/info.tsx` and replace with your credentials:

```typescript
/* AUTOGENERATED FILE - DO NOT EDIT CONTENTS */

export const projectId = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
export const publicAnonKey = "YOUR_ANON_KEY"
```

## Step 4: Set Up Backend Environment Variables (Required for Server Functions)

You'll also need to configure these secrets in your Supabase project:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Edge Functions** → **Settings**
3. Add these environment variables:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`: Your full project URL (e.g., `https://yourprojectid.supabase.co`)
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your public anon key
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Your service role key (found in Settings → API → service_role key - **keep this secret!**)
   - `SUPABASE_DB_URL`: Your database connection string (found in Settings → Database → Connection string → URI)

## Step 5: (Optional) Configure LLM API for Chatbot

To enable AI-powered chatbot responses, add:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

If you don't set an LLM API key, the chatbot will use rule-based responses (still functional, but less conversational).

## Step 6: Initialize the Database

The application uses a key-value store table. The table is created automatically by the backend when first accessed, but you can verify it exists:

1. Go to **Table Editor** in your Supabase Dashboard
2. Look for a table named `kv_store_b8961ff5`
3. If it doesn't exist, it will be created automatically on first use

## Step 7: Enable Authentication (Optional)

If you want to use Google or GitHub OAuth:

1. Go to **Authentication** → **Providers** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Enable Google and/or GitHub providers
3. Follow the setup instructions for each provider
4. See `AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Security Warning**: Never commit the `service_role` key to version control or expose it in frontend code. It should only be used in backend/server functions.

✅ After making these changes, your SkillMiner app will use your own Supabase project with your own data and configuration!

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Getting "Unauthorized" errors
- **Solution**: Make sure you've set all environment variables in Supabase Edge Functions settings

**Issue**: Chatbot not responding intelligently
- **Solution**: Add an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable

**Issue**: Database errors
- **Solution**: Check that your `SUPABASE_DB_URL` is correct and the database is accessible
